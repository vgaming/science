This mod adds another component to the game: Science. You can spend gold to research:

* Economy (village income +1)
* Recruitment (new recruit type)
* New Era (new units are stronger than old ones)
* Fundamental Research (reduce research cost)

Planned:

* spying on enemies to get report on their advances?
* share your ideas to add them here!!! Anything that avoids micro-management is a good candidate.
