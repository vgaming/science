This mod adds another component to the game: Science.

Current science advances:

* unit recruit types. Initially you only have a Peasant recruit, but you can research more!
* more strength on enemy territory (to avoid early unit rush, your damage on hostile territory is considerably reduced). This advance increases your strength on hostile territory.
* village income.

Planned:

* share your ideas to add them here!!! Anything that avoids micro-management is a good candidate.
* spying on enemies to get report of their advances?
